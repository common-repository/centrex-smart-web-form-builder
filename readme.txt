The Centrex Smart Web Form Builder allows you to build forms on your WordPress website, fully integrating your WordPress website with Centrex CRM.

== Description ==

The Centrex Smart Web Form Builder allows you to build web forms on your WordPress website where all the data and docs collected via that web form builder will be fully integrated into your Centrex CRM, LOS, or Mobile App.  Though any web form can be built using the Centrex Smart Web Form Builder, most Centrex customers build forms for borrowers looking for money, Brokers or ISOâ€™s looking to partner up and do business, and/or investors or syndicates looking to invest in your business finance or fintech company.

The Centrex Smart Web Form Builder has elements like integers, date, multiple choice, multiple select, note box, docs for uploading, and much more.  One of the best elements within the Centrex Smart Web Form Builder is its integration with Plaid.  Right on your website borrowers can link their bank accounts which will then securely push that financial data directly into your Centrex CRM, LOS, or mobile app.

We Need Your Feedback and Support

The quality and upkeep of the Centrex Smart Web Form Builder relies heavily on good feedback from Centrex customers and users. If you have an idea or would like the dev team to make an enhancement, please email support@CentrexSoftware.com, and they will assist with your idea or requirement.

**Privacy Notices**

With the default configuration, the Centrex Smart Web Form Builder does not:

- Does not track users by stealth
- Write any user personal data to a database outside the Centrex CRM/LOS
- Send any data to external servers unless using the Plaid element in the form builder
- Use Cookies

If you have configured the Centrex Smart Web Form Builder in such a way where it is pulling financial data and/or credit data, then IP addresses and sessions are created and stored.  To keep your customers' financial and credit data secure, the Centrex Smart Web Form Builder will communicate with a Centrex owned, SOC II Type II compliant Microsoft Azure server.  The vendors that require a Microsoft Azure secure connection are:

- Plaid
- Meridian Link
- CLEAR

We highly recommend having a privacy policy disclaimer on your web form near the call-to-action button.
